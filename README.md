# Dual learning

For now, this repo only contains a survey paper I wrote on dual learning back in July 2020 as part of my master's program. Interesting to see how this learning paradigm has evolved.

Dual learning was originally introduced by He et al. (2016), though it has been largely overshadowed by the popular GAN which was invented a few years prior.
